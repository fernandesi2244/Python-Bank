# Python-Bank
This is a quick Python project to represent a virtual bank system (for Python practice).
Also, I embedded a "Bank Research Initiative" mini-project to practice handling and analyzing data.

# About
I just made this project to explore some of the basics of Python.

The main project features 5 Python programs that comprise a virtual bank system:

- Bank.py
    Represents a bank
- BankAccount.py
    Represents an account that a customer holds
- BankEmpire.py
    Represents a system of banks that operate under the same organization
- Customer.py
    Represents a customer of a bank
- HighNetWorthCustomer.py
    Represents a high-net-worth customer who would receive special attention
    
    
There is also one Python file (Simulation.py) for testing some of the features of the banking system:
