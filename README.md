# Python-Bank
A quick Python program to represent a virtual bank system (Python practice)

# About
I just made this project to explore some of the basics of Python.

This project features 5 Python programs that comprise a virtual bank system:

- Bank.py
    Represents a bank
- BankAccount.py
    Represents an account that a customer holds
- BankEmpire.py
    Represents a system of banks that operate under the same organization
- Customer.py
    Represents a customer of a bank
- HighNetWorthCustomer.py
    Represents a high-net-worth customer who would receive special attention
    
    
There is also one Python file for testing some of the features of the banking system:

- Simulation.py
